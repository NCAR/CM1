Some code in CM1 was adapted from other numerical models, including:

 - The Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A)
   (wsm6,ysu,tiedtke)

- The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model
  (land-surface model, surface layer model, ocean mixed-layer model,
   several microphysics schemes, rrtmg radiation scheme)

- The Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), which is developed by the
  Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms at the University of Oklahoma
  (atmospheric radiation codes)

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has supported George Bryan during the
development of this code through grants ATM-9806309 and ATM-0133506 and by
NSF's support of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
