## What is CM1?

_In scientific terms_:  CM1 is a three-dimensional, non-hydrostatic, non-linear, time-dependent numerical model designed for idealized studies of atmospheric phenomena.

_In non-scientific terms_:  CM1 is a computer program used for atmospheric research.  It is designed for studies of relatively small-scale processes in the Earth's atmosphere, such as thunderstorms.
