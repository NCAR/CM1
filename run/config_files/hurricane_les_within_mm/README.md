  Idealized hurricane simulation, 3D, using the LES-within-mesoscale-model
  configuration (ie, large-eddy-simulation without a PBL parameterization 
  near center of domain; mesoscale modeling with a PBL parameterization
  at larger radii).

  This case uses the "Moist Tropical" sounding from Dunion (2011, J. Climate, 
  pg 893), by default, with a sea-surface temperature of 28 C.
