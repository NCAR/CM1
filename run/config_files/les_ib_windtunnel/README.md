 Test case using immersed boundary method.  (testcase=12)  

 Based on wind tunnel data published by Martinuzzi and Tropea (1993, 
 Journal of Fluids Engineering).

 Note: default resolution is rather coarse (50 grid points across channel).  
 This default setup is designed to be inexpensive, for users to get started  
 quickly.  Journal-quality simulations should use higher resolution.
